## Question 1: Global Temperature 2024 vs 2023

**Question**: "Will the average global temperature in 2024 exceed 2023?"
**Question ID**: TPkEjiNb1wVCIGFnPcDD
**Market Freeze Value**: 0.757 (75.7% market consensus)

### Results by Time Horizon

#### 7-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2024-07-28)

- **Prediction**: 85% probability
- **Actual Value**: 100% (YES - it did exceed)
- **Brier Score**: 0.023 (excellent)
- **Reasoning**: "Strong evidence of unprecedented warming trend balanced against remaining uncertainties and potential cooling mechanisms"

#### 30-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2024-08-20)

- **Prediction**: 92% probability
- **Actual Value**: 100% (YES)
- **Brier Score**: 0.006 (excellent)
- **Reasoning**: "High probability justified by unprecedented streak of monthly records, consistent warming trend, and multiple independent confirmations, while maintaining appropriate uncertainty for remaining months"

#### 90-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2024-10-19)

- **Prediction**: 85% probability
- **Actual Value**: 100% (YES)
- **Brier Score**: 0.023 (excellent)
- **Reasoning**: "While evidence strongly supports 2024 exceeding 2023 temperatures based on unprecedented warming through August, prudent calibration requires acknowledging Q4 uncertainties"

#### 180-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2025-01-17)

- **Prediction**: 99% probability
- **Actual Value**: 100% (YES)
- **Brier Score**: 0.0001 (near perfect)
- **Reasoning**: "Conclusive evidence from multiple authoritative sources (WMO, NASA, Copernicus) confirms 2024 exceeded 2023 temperatures, with first-ever breach of 1.5°C threshold"

**Analysis**: Excellent performance. AI correctly identified this as very likely, with confidence appropriately increasing over time as more data became available.

## Question 2: Paris Olympics Seine Water Quality

**Question**: "Will any event of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games be postponed or cancelled due to the water quality of the Seine?"
**Question ID**: KCFbp1TH0RYN4j5zYdmh
**Market Freeze Value**: 0.646 (64.6% market consensus)

### Results by Time Horizon

#### 7-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2024-07-28)

- **Prediction**: 45% probability
- **Actual Value**: 100% (YES - events were postponed)
- **Brier Score**: 0.303 (poor)
- **Reasoning**: "Multiple credible news sources and official Olympic statements confirm the men's triathlon was postponed due to unsafe Seine water quality, definitively answering the question"

#### 30-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2024-08-20)

- **Prediction**: 45% probability
- **Actual Value**: 100% (YES)
- **Brier Score**: 0.303 (poor)
- **Reasoning**: "Multiple major news sources confirmed official postponements and cancellations of Olympic events due to Seine water quality issues, making this a certainty rather than a forecast"

#### 90-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2024-10-19)

- **Prediction**: 45% probability
- **Actual Value**: 100% (YES)
- **Brier Score**: 0.303 (poor)
- **Reasoning**: "Multiple high-quality sources confirm that Olympic events were postponed and cancelled due to Seine water quality, including the men's triathlon and training sessions"

#### 180-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2025-01-17)

- **Prediction**: 45% probability
- **Actual Value**: 100% (YES)
- **Brier Score**: 0.303 (poor)
- **Reasoning**: "Multiple independent sources confirm that Olympic events were postponed due to Seine water quality issues, with the men's triathlon specifically postponed on July 30, 2024"

**Analysis**: Major prediction error. Despite the AI's reasoning clearly stating that events were confirmed to be postponed, it still predicted only 45% probability instead of near 100%. This suggests a serious calibration issue with retrospective analysis.

## Question 3: Electric Vehicle Adoption by 2030

**Question**: "Will the majority of new cars sold be electric vehicles by the end of 2030?"
**Question ID**: q6wJThcy6TJnQKrbjALm
**Market Freeze Value**: 0.691 (69.1% market consensus)

### Results by Time Horizon

#### 7-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2024-07-28)

- **Prediction**: 45% probability
- **Actual Value**: 74.4% (continuous resolution value)
- **Brier Score**: 0.087 (good)
- **Reasoning**: "While technological and policy drivers support significant EV adoption growth, infrastructure constraints and consumer resistance suggest majority adoption by 2030 is unlikely but possible"

#### 30-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2024-08-20)

- **Prediction**: 45% probability
- **Actual Value**: 74.4%
- **Brier Score**: 0.087 (good)
- **Reasoning**: "While current 14% market share and strong growth trajectory support significant expansion, infrastructure constraints and recent market slowdowns suggest majority adoption by 2030 is unlikely. 45% represents a realistic but ambitious target given evidence quality and implementation challenges."

#### 90-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2024-10-19)

- **Prediction**: 35% probability
- **Actual Value**: 74.4%
- **Brier Score**: 0.155 (fair)
- **Reasoning**: "While EV adoption is growing rapidly, achieving majority global sales by 2030 faces substantial hurdles in infrastructure, supply chain, and consumer acceptance across all markets"

#### 180-Day Horizon (Cutoff: 2025-01-17)

- **Prediction**: 35% probability
- **Actual Value**: 74.4%
- **Brier Score**: 0.155 (fair)
- **Reasoning**: "While EV adoption will continue to grow significantly, reaching majority (>50%) global sales by 2030 faces too many concurrent challenges in infrastructure, supply chains, and market acceptance to be likely"

**Analysis**: Conservative predictions that underestimated the actual resolution value. The AI was too pessimistic about EV adoption rates.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **No Articles Found Problem**

**Issue**: All predictions show `"total_articles_found": 0` despite claiming evidence from news sources.

**Possible Causes**:

- Google News API key issues
- Search query limitations
- Date filtering problems (cutoff dates may be preventing searches)
- API rate limiting

### 2. **Retrospective Analysis Calibration**

**Issue**: When AI has definitive evidence that something already happened, it still provides low probabilities.

**Example**: Question 2 - AI reasoning states "Multiple credible news sources confirm the men's triathlon was postponed" but predicts only 45% probability instead of ~100%.

### 3. **Conservative Bias**

**Issue**: AI tends toward 45% probability across multiple questions and horizons, suggesting it defaults to uncertainty rather than adjusting based on evidence strength.

## Performance Summary by Time Horizon

| Horizon | Avg Prediction | Avg Actual | Avg Brier Score | Performance |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 7-day   | 58.3%          | 91.5%      | 0.137           | Good        |
| 30-day  | 60.7%          | 91.5%      | 0.132           | Good        |
| 90-day  | 55.0%          | 91.5%      | 0.160           | Fair        |
| 180-day | 59.7%          | 91.5%      | 0.153           | Fair        |

**Pattern**: Performance is inconsistent across time horizons, when it should generally improve with more available information.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Article Search**: Investigate why `total_articles_found: 0` for all predictions
2. **Improve Retrospective Calibration**: When AI has definitive evidence, probabilities should reflect that certainty
3. **Address Conservative Bias**: Reduce tendency to default to ~45% probability
4. **Enhance Time Horizon Logic**: Later cutoff dates should generally have higher confidence for resolved events
