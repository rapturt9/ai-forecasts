# Detailed Prediction Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

Analysis of the first 3 questions from ForecastBench shows significant prediction accuracy issues, with an overall average Brier score of 0.145. The predictions were systematically underconfident, particularly for questions that resolved to "YES" (1.0).

## Question-by-Question Analysis

### Question 1: Global Temperature 2024 vs 2023 (TPkEjiNb1wVCIGFnPcDD)

**Question**: "Will the average global temperature in 2024 exceed 2023?"
**Market Freeze Value**: 0.7566 (75.66%)
**Actual Resolution**: 1.0 (YES - confirmed)

#### Predictions vs Reality

| Time Horizon      | Prediction | Actual | Brier Score | Reasoning                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7d (2024-07-28)   | 0.85       | 1.0    | 0.0225      | "Strong evidence of unprecedented warming trend balanced against remaining uncertainties"                                  |
| 30d (2024-08-20)  | 0.92       | 1.0    | 0.0064      | "High probability justified by unprecedented streak of monthly records, consistent warming trend"                          |
| 90d (2024-10-19)  | 0.85       | 1.0    | 0.0225      | "Evidence strongly supports 2024 exceeding 2023 temperatures, prudent calibration requires acknowledging Q4 uncertainties" |
| 180d (2025-01-17) | 0.99       | 1.0    | 0.0001      | "Conclusive evidence from multiple authoritative sources (WMO, NASA, Copernicus) confirms 2024 exceeded 2023"              |

**Analysis**: This was the best-performing question. The AI correctly identified the warming trend and became more confident over time as more data became available. The 180-day prediction was nearly perfect.

### Question 2: Paris Olympics Seine Water Quality (KCFbp1TH0RYN4j5zYdmh)

**Question**: "Will any event of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games be postponed or cancelled due to the water quality of the Seine?"
**Market Freeze Value**: 0.6459 (64.59%)
**Actual Resolution**: 1.0 (YES - events were postponed)

#### Predictions vs Reality

| Time Horizon      | Prediction | Actual | Brier Score | Reasoning                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7d (2024-07-28)   | 0.45       | 1.0    | 0.3025      | "Multiple credible news sources confirm the men's triathlon was postponed due to unsafe Seine water quality"               |
| 30d (2024-08-20)  | 0.45       | 1.0    | 0.3025      | "Multiple major news sources confirmed official postponements and cancellations"                                           |
| 90d (2024-10-19)  | 0.45       | 1.0    | 0.3025      | "Multiple high-quality sources confirm Olympic events were postponed due to Seine water quality"                           |
| 180d (2025-01-17) | 0.45       | 1.0    | 0.3025      | "Multiple independent sources confirm Olympic events were postponed, men's triathlon specifically postponed July 30, 2024" |

**Analysis**: This was the worst-performing question. Despite having evidence that events were already postponed, the AI consistently predicted only 45% probability. This suggests a major calibration error - the AI should have been near 100% confident once the events had already occurred.

### Question 3: Electric Vehicle Market Share 2030 (q6wJThcy6TJnQKrbjALm)

**Question**: "Will the majority of new cars sold be electric vehicles by the end of 2030?"
**Market Freeze Value**: 0.6913 (69.13%)
**Actual Resolution**: 0.7442 (continuous value, ~74.42%)

#### Predictions vs Reality

| Time Horizon      | Prediction | Actual | Brier Score | Reasoning                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7d (2024-07-28)   | 0.45       | 0.7442 | 0.0865      | "While technological and policy drivers support significant EV adoption growth, infrastructure constraints suggest majority adoption unlikely" |
| 30d (2024-08-20)  | 0.45       | 0.7442 | 0.0865      | "Current 14% market share and strong growth trajectory, but infrastructure constraints suggest majority adoption unlikely"                     |
| 90d (2024-10-19)  | 0.35       | 0.7442 | 0.1554      | "EV adoption growing rapidly, but achieving majority global sales faces substantial hurdles"                                                   |
| 180d (2025-01-17) | 0.35       | 0.7442 | 0.1554      | "EV adoption will continue to grow significantly, but reaching majority faces too many challenges"                                             |

**Analysis**: The AI was significantly underconfident, predicting 35-45% when the actual resolution was 74.42%. The reasoning focused too heavily on barriers and constraints rather than accelerating adoption trends.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Systematic Underconfidence

- Average prediction across all questions: 0.575
- Average actual value: 0.915
- The AI consistently predicted lower probabilities than warranted

### 2. Inadequate Use of Available Information

- For Question 2, the AI had evidence that events were already postponed but only predicted 45%
- For Question 3, the market freeze value (69%) was higher than the AI's predictions (35-45%)

### 3. Google News Search Problems

- All searches returned 0 articles found
- This severely limited the quality of evidence available
- Search queries were generic: "Multiple strategic search approaches"

### 4. Time Horizon Inconsistencies

- Some questions showed decreasing confidence over longer time horizons (Question 3)
- This is counterintuitive for questions where more information should increase confidence

## Brier Score Performance

### By Time Horizon

- 7-day average: 0.137 (3 predictions)
- 30-day average: 0.132 (3 predictions)
- 90-day average: 0.160 (3 predictions)
- 180-day average: 0.153 (3 predictions)

### Overall Performance

- **Total Brier scores**: 12
- **Average Brier score**: 0.145
- **Best question**: Global temperature (avg Brier: 0.014)
- **Worst question**: Seine water quality (avg Brier: 0.303)

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Fix Google News Integration

- Investigate why searches return 0 articles
- Improve search query generation
- Implement fallback data sources

### 2. Improve Outcome Detection

- Better logic for detecting when events have already occurred
- When definitive evidence exists, predictions should approach 100%

### 3. Calibration Improvements

- Adjust for systematic underconfidence
- Better use of market freeze values as baseline information
- Implement reference class forecasting

### 4. Time Horizon Logic

- Ensure predictions become more accurate with more available information
- Implement proper uncertainty reduction over time

### 5. JSON Parsing Robustness

- Fix CrewAI JSON output parsing errors
- Implement better fallback parsing mechanisms
- Ensure consistent structured output format

## Technical Issues to Address

1. **CrewAI JSON Validation Errors**: Tasks failing due to malformed JSON output
2. **Google News Cache Issues**: Zero articles being found despite cache files existing
3. **Reasoning Truncation**: Full reasoning not being preserved in logs (fixed)
4. **Prediction Calibration**: Systematic bias toward lower probabilities

This analysis reveals that while the technical infrastructure is working, there are significant accuracy and calibration issues that need to be addressed for reliable forecasting performance.
