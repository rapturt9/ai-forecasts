# AI Forecasting System

A minimal, focused AI forecasting system with advanced agent frameworks (Inspect AI + CrewAI) and 3 core functionalities.

## 🎯 Core Functionalities

### 1. ForecastBench Parallel Evaluation

Run the Google News Superforecaster on ForecastBench dataset in parallel for performance evaluation.

### 2. Next.js Trading Interface Frontend

Complete trading interface for strategy development and forecast prediction with real-time market analysis.

### 3. Manifold API Trading & Backtesting

Live trading and historical backtesting using Manifold Markets API with Kelly Criterion optimization.

## 🧠 Agent Framework

### Dual Framework Support

The system supports both **Inspect AI** (recommended) and **CrewAI** frameworks:

- **Inspect AI**: Enhanced evaluation, monitoring, and parallel execution capabilities
- **CrewAI**: Backwards compatibility and proven stability
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamless fallback to CrewAI if Inspect AI is unavailable
- **Environment Control**: Configure via `USE_INSPECT_AI` environment variable

### Benefits of Inspect AI

- **Better Evaluation**: Built-in evaluation and monitoring tools
- **Parallel Processing**: True parallel execution of debate agents
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Better observability and error handling
- **Structured Tasks**: More organized task definition and execution

## 🤖 Agent Groups

### Single Core Agent Group

- **Google News Superforecaster** (`src/ai_forecasts/agents/google_news_superforecaster.py`)
  - Advanced superforecasting with Google News integration
  - Bias correction and evidence quality assessment
  - **Dual Framework Support**: Inspect AI (default) + CrewAI for backwards compatibility
  - Enhanced debate methodology with parallel agent execution

### Market Agent Group

- **Market Agent** (`src/ai_forecasts/agents/market_agent.py`)
  - Integrates superforecaster with Manifold Markets trading
  - Kelly Criterion position sizing
  - Sophisticated trading decision logic

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Node.js dependencies for frontend
cd trading-interface && npm install && cd ..
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Core API Keys
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
MANIFOLD_API_KEY=your_manifold_key_here  # Optional for live trading
SERP_API_KEY=your_serp_key_here          # Optional for Google News

# Agent Framework Configuration
USE_INSPECT_AI=true                      # Use Inspect AI (recommended) or CrewAI
DEFAULT_MODEL=openai/gpt-4.1             # Model for forecasting
```

### Start the Complete System

```bash
# Start the FastAPI backend server
python api_server.py

# In a new terminal, start the Next.js frontend
cd trading-interface && PORT=12000 npm run dev
```

**Access the system at:** http://localhost:12000

## 📋 How to Run Everything

### 1. 🧪 ForecastBench Parallel Evaluation

Evaluates the Google News Superforecaster on the ForecastBench dataset with proper Brier score calculation across multiple time horizons.

```bash
python run_forecastbench.py
python run_forecastbench.py --failure-questions --max-questions 3 --max-workers 10
```

**What it does:**

- Loads all 200 questions from [ForecastBench human dataset](https://github.com/forecastingresearch/forecastbench-datasets/blob/main/datasets/question_sets/2024-07-21-human.json)
- For each question, generates **4 predictions** for different time horizons:
  - **7-day horizon**: Short-term prediction
  - **30-day horizon**: Medium-term prediction
  - **90-day horizon**: Long-term prediction
  - **180-day horizon**: Extended-term prediction
- Calculates **Brier scores** for each time horizon using resolution data from [resolution set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forecastingresearch/forecastbench-datasets/refs/heads/main/datasets/resolution_sets/2024-07-21_resolution_set.json)
- Matches predictions to resolutions by question ID and resolution date
- Processes questions in parallel using multiple workers

**Brier Score Calculation:**

- Each question gets 4 separate Brier scores (one per time horizon)
- Scores are calculated by matching question IDs with resolution dates
- Final metrics include average Brier scores across all time horizons
- Lower Brier scores indicate better forecasting accuracy

**Configuration:**

- `max_questions`: Number of questions to process (default: 200 for full evaluation)
- `max_workers`: Number of parallel workers (default: 3)
- `time_horizons`: [7, 30, 90, 180] days

**Output:**

- Console logs with progress and Brier scores by time horizon
- Detailed JSON results file with 4 predictions per question
- Performance metrics including average Brier scores
- Time horizon analysis and forecasting accuracy breakdown
