## 🎯 Performance Categories

### ✅ **Excellent Performance (Brier < 0.1)**
1. **Belichick NFL Coach** (0.0213): Correctly predicted low probability
2. **Video Game Olympics** (0.0670): Good calibration on low probability event

### ⚠️ **Mixed Performance (0.1 ≤ Brier < 0.3)**
3. **NASDAQ 100** (0.1831): Good on longer horizons, poor on 7-day
4. **CCL Stock** (0.2756): Better on longer horizons

### ❌ **Poor Performance (Brier ≥ 0.3)**
5. **Apple iPhone LLM** (0.5094): Overestimated probability (predicted ~75%, actual 0%)
6. **Eigenlayer Token** (0.3188): Moderate overestimation
7. **Taylor Swift** (0.5663): Significant overestimation
8. **Elon Musk Opinion** (0.3756): Moderate overestimation  
9. **French Weather** (0.4388): Poor calibration across horizons
10. **Brent Oil** (0.4575): Consistent overestimation

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 🎯 **What Worked Well**
- **Sports/Entertainment Questions**: Belichick NFL and Video Game Olympics performed excellently
- **Longer Time Horizons**: Some questions (NASDAQ, CCL) improved with longer forecasting periods
- **Low Probability Events**: System correctly identified and calibrated some unlikely events

### ❌ **What Needs Improvement**
- **Technology Questions**: Apple iPhone LLM prediction was significantly off
- **Market Predictions**: Mixed results on financial markets (NASDAQ, CCL, Oil)
- **Opinion/Sentiment**: Elon Musk opinion question poorly calibrated
- **Weather Forecasting**: French weather prediction inconsistent across horizons

### 📊 **Calibration Issues**
- **Overconfidence**: Many predictions were too high compared to actual outcomes
- **Binary Events**: Struggled with yes/no questions that resolved to 0
- **Market vs. Actual**: Large gaps between predictions and actual resolutions

## 🛠️ Optimization Recommendations

### 1. **Enhanced Base Rate Analysis**
- Implement more conservative base rates for technology adoption
- Better historical analysis for market movements
- Improved reference class selection for opinion questions

### 2. **Bias Correction**
- Stronger correction for optimism bias in technology predictions
- Better anchoring on market freeze values
- Enhanced skepticism for high-confidence predictions

### 3. **Domain-Specific Improvements**
- **Technology**: More conservative estimates for new feature adoption
- **Markets**: Better integration of technical analysis and economic indicators
- **Weather**: Improved meteorological data integration
- **Opinion**: Better modeling of user base characteristics

### 4. **Calibration Techniques**
- Implement systematic probability adjustment based on question type
- Add confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- Use ensemble methods combining multiple forecasting approaches

## 🎯 Next Steps for < 0.1 Target

To achieve the target Brier score < 0.1, focus on:

1. **Conservative Calibration**: Reduce overconfidence in predictions
2. **Question-Type Specialization**: Develop specialized prompts for different domains
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple forecasting approaches
4. **Historical Validation**: Test prompts against historical question sets
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on performance feedback

## 📈 Success Rate Analysis

- **Questions meeting target (< 0.1)**: 2/10 (20%)
- **Questions close to target (< 0.2)**: 4/10 (40%)
- **Questions needing major improvement (≥ 0.3)**: 6/10 (60%)

The system shows promise with excellent performance on 2 questions and reasonable performance on 2 more, but significant improvements are needed for the remaining 6 questions to achieve the overall target of Brier < 0.1.
