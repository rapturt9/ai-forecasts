### 3. 💰 Manifold API Trading & Backtesting
Live trading and backtesting system using Manifold Markets API.

```bash
python run_manifold_trading.py
```

**What it does:**
- Demonstrates Kelly Criterion calculations
- Runs backtesting simulations (30-day period)
- Shows optimal position sizing strategies
- Calculates risk metrics and performance analytics

**Features:**
- **Kelly Criterion Demo**: Shows optimal bet sizing for different scenarios
- **Backtesting Engine**: Simulates trading performance over time periods
- **Risk Management**: Calculates Sharpe ratios, max drawdown, win rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Total returns, trade statistics, risk analysis

**Sample Output:**
```
🎯 Kelly Criterion Demonstration
📈 Strong bullish signal:
   Forecast: 75.0%, Market: 60.0%
   Edge: 15.0%
   Kelly Fraction: 12.5%
   Position Size: $125.00

📊 Backtesting Results:
   Initial Balance: $1000.00
