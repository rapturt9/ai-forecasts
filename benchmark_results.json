However, there are several blocking factors that could prevent this outcome, such as macroeconomic downturns, regulatory challenges, or the inability of the leading AI company to maintain its competitive advantage.\n\nBy examining historical analogies, such as the rapid rise of tech giants in the early 2000s and the emergence of disruptive platforms in the 2010s, we can gain insights into the potential timeline and key milestones for this outcome.

The key preconditions are Apple's ability to attract top AI talent, make breakthroughs in core AI technologies, and successfully integrate these capabilities into a user-friendly virtual assistant product. There are several blocking factors, such as Apple's struggles to develop the necessary AI capabilities or to gain consumer adoption of the new assistant. Historical analogies suggest that while it is possible for a tech giant like Apple to rapidly advance its AI offerings, it often takes multiple iterations and years of sustained investment to catch up to market leaders. Overall, I estimate a 45% probability that Apple will release an AI assistant better than Siri within the next 12-18 months, with a medium level of confidence in this assessment."
