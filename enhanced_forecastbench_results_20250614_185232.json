The anchor for short-term probabilistic judgment is the station\u2019s historical base rate (ca. 33%), with a justified upward adjustment for decadal warming trends and a robust 2024 warm seasonal forecast (adding ~10\u201315 percentage points). However, the lack of an explicit short-term heat anomaly forecast for the critical date and the station\u2019s persistent day-to-day volatility argue against a 50%+ probability, keeping the best-calibrated forecast just below the majority line\u2014at 46%. This reflects the weighted synthesis of both inside (climate state, forecast, historical 2024 context) and outside (station record, local forecast absence) views.",
