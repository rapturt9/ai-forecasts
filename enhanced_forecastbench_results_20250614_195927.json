Given that 2023 is trending to be the hottest year on record, if this trend continues, it's likely that 2024 will be even hotter.\n\n2. Low Probability Argument:\nHowever, year-to-year temperature fluctuations can be influenced by numerous factors, including natural variabilities such as volcanic eruptions or El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a events, which can temporarily cool or warm the planet. Thus, it's possible that such an event could occur in 2024, resulting in a lower average temperature than 2023.\n\n3. Final Probability Estimate:\nPROBABILITY: 0.75\n\n4.

Brief Reasoning:\nWhile the long-term trend of increasing global temperatures supports the high probability scenario, the potential for natural temperature-influencing events introduces some uncertainty. However, given the current state of the prediction market and the prevailing scientific consensus on climate change, a slightly high probability estimate seems reasonable.

Additionally, greenhouse gas emissions, which are the primary cause of global warming, continue to rise globally, suggesting that the underlying drivers of temperature increase are still in place.\n\n2. Low probability argument: Even though the long-term trend is towards increasing temperatures, there can be year-to-year variability due to various factors such as volcanic activity, solar output fluctuations, and natural climate phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, which could potentially result in a cooler 2024 compared to 2023.\n\n3. Final Probability Estimate: Given the long-term warming trend and the continuation of greenhouse gas emissions, the probability of 2024 being warmer than 2023 is high. However, considering the potential for year-to-year variability, the probability is not certain. \n\nPROBABILITY: 0.8\n\n4.

Paris has promised to clean up the Seine ahead of the 2024 Olympics, but it's a massive task with considerable uncertainties. The pollution may not be completely mitigated by the time of the Olympics, and if the water quality standards are not met, events could be postponed or cancelled.\n\n2. Low Probability Argument: The French Government and the Paris Olympic Committee are committed to ensuring that the Seine River is clean enough for the Olympic events. They have pledged significant resources towards the clean-up of the Seine, and it is highly likely that they will meet the necessary water quality standards before the games begin. Furthermore, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has strict policies on water quality for athletes' safety, which will push the Paris Olympic Committee to ensure the Seine meets these standards.\n\n3. Final Probability Estimate: 0.7\n\n4. Confidence Level: Medium\n\n5. Reasoning: Given the historical problems with the water quality of the Seine and the complexity of cleaning up a large river system, there is a reasonable chance that some events might be affected. However, the commitment of the French Government and the Paris Olympic Committee, as well as the pressure from the IOC, should not be underestimated.
