Let's identify the top 10 most incorrect predictions. To do this, we'll calculate the absolute difference between the predicted probability and the actual value for each horizon, and then pick the largest across all horizons for a given question. The Brier score (squared error) would give a similar ranking, but the absolute difference gives a more direct sense of the magnitude of the "wrongness."

A prediction is "incorrect" when it is high for a `0.0` actual value, or low for a `1.0` actual value.

Here are the top 10 most incorrectly predicted questions from your provided data, along with their question number (index) and an analysis:

**Top 10 Most Incorrect Predictions:**

1.  **Question Number: 20 (`4puVWhIkvQiHnTxbH4NL`)**
    *   **Question:** Will Apple’s next iPhone (2024) include an on-device LLM “ChatBot”?
    *   **Prediction (all horizons):** `0.99`
    *   **Actual Value (all horizons):** `0.0`
    *   **Absolute Error:** `|0.99 - 0.0| = 0.99`
    *   **Why Incorrect:** The model was extremely confident (99%) that the 2024 iPhone would include an on-device LLM chatbot, but this feature was ultimately *not* included (resolved to 0.0). The reasoning cited "Strong evidence from multiple high-quality sources confirms implementation". This suggests the model relied on information that turned out to be false or misinterpreted pre-release rumors/leaks as concrete feature confirmations, especially since the actual resolution was 0.0 (meaning *no* on-device LLM chatbot was included). This indicates a significant failure in factual accuracy or in distinguishing between speculation/marketing and final product features.

2.  **Question Number: 47 (`1373`)**
    *   **Question:** Will at least five more exoplanets be found to be potentially habitable between 1 February 2024 and 31 December 2024?
    *   **Prediction (all horizons):** `0.99`
    *   **Actual Value (all horizons):** `0.0`
    *   **Absolute Error:** `|0.99 - 0.0| = 0.99`
    *   **Why Incorrect:** The model was highly confident (99%) that at least five more potentially habitable exoplanets would be found in 2024, but this did not materialize (resolved to 0.0). The reasoning claimed "Multiple reliable sources confirm more than 5 potentially habitable exoplanets were discovered in 2024". This is a direct factual error on the model's part, indicating either outdated information, hallucination, or an incorrect definition of "potentially habitable" or "discovered" from its sources.

3.  **Question Number: 92 (`ccda7990a2565cabd7c375a036751bd3b953b8bed45d859010919cd3a84d7e78`)**
    *   **Question:** Will there be more than ten times as many 'Violence against civilians' in Montenegro...
    *   **Prediction (all horizons):** `0.95`
    *   **Actual Value (all horizons):** `0.0`
    *   **Absolute Error:** `|0.95 - 0.0| = 0.95`
    *   **Why Incorrect:** The model predicted a 95% likelihood of a significant increase in violence against civilians, but the event did not occur as per the threshold (resolved to 0.0). The reasoning "Single confirmed incident of 12 civilian deaths represents clear evidence of exceeding ten times normal baseline" suggests the model might have found an isolated incident and incorrectly concluded it would meet the specific (and quite high) "ten times as many" criteria or that such an incident indeed happened within the specified time frame to trigger the resolution. It's a miscalculation of the base rate and the impact of a single event on the long-term trend, or an incorrect factual assessment of whether a threshold was met.

4.  **Question Number: 76 (`0x60752c2a562d7faff00a82238520a13a9a5a5ee2927afd397d224dc54361afd6`)**
    *   **Question:** Tesla Robotaxi unveiling delayed?
    *   **Prediction (all horizons):** `0.85`
    *   **Actual Value (all horizons):** `1.0`
    *   **Absolute Error:** `|0.85 - 1.0| = 0.15`
    *   **Why Incorrect:** The question asks if the unveiling was *delayed*, and the actual value resolved to 1.0, meaning "Yes, it was delayed". The model correctly predicted a high probability (85%) of delay. This is actually a **correct** prediction if the interpretation is "Yes, it will be delayed." I've listed it here due to the phrasing "most incorrectly" which could sometimes be misconstrued, but in reality, this one is good.

5.  **Question Number: 7 (`YulPWDHFTUkekmrO3v4J`)**
    *   **Question:** [2024 Formula 1 Season] Will Oscar Piastri or Daniel Ricciardo win a race?
    *   **Prediction (all horizons):** `1.0`
    *   **Actual Value (all horizons):** `null`
    *   **Absolute Error:** Cannot calculate.
    *   **Why excluded from Top 10 calculation (but noteworthy):** The question has a `null` `actual_values`. The model predicted 1.0, and if the event actually happened later, this would be a correct high probability. But since it's `null`, it hasn't resolved yet in the provided data.

6.  **Question Number: 57 (`1353`)**
    *   **Question:** Will there be an agreed-upon pause in the conflict between Israel and Hamas that starts before 1 December 2024 and lasts at least 30 days?
    *   **Prediction (all horizons):** `0.65`
    *   **Actual Value (all horizons):** `0.0`
    *   **Absolute Error:** `|0.65 - 0.0| = 0.65`
    *   **Why Incorrect:** The model predicted a 65% chance of a long-lasting ceasefire, but it did not occur (resolved to 0.0). The reasoning mentions "strong recent evidence while maintaining healthy skepticism about implementation challenges." It seems the skepticism wasn't strong enough, or the "strong recent evidence" for a pause was either temporary or failed to meet the very specific criteria (agreed-upon, before Dec 1, lasting at least 30 days). The volatility and difficulty of forecasting this conflict likely contributed to the error.

7.  **Question Number: 144 (`T10YIE`)**
    *   **Question:** Will the US' 10-year breakeven inflation rate have increased by {resolution_date} as compared to its value on {forecast_due_date}?
    *   **Prediction (all horizons):** `0.65`
    *   **Actual Value:** `0.0` (for 7d, 30d, 90d); `1.0` (for 180d)
    *   **Absolute Error (worst case for short-term):** `|0.65 - 0.0| = 0.65`
    *   **Why Incorrect:** While the prediction became correct for the 180-day horizon, for the 7d, 30d, and 90d horizons, the model incorrectly predicted a 65% chance of an increase when it did not occur. The model successfully identified a long-term trend (as seen by the 180d correction) but failed to account for shorter-term fluctuations or periods of decline. Its uniform prediction across horizons for a dynamic financial metric shows a lack of temporal nuance.

8.  **Question Number: 135 (`TMBACBW027SBOG`)**
    *   **Question:** Will the total dollar amount of mortgage-backed securities held by all US commercial banks have increased by {resolution_date} as compared to its value on {forecast_due_date}?
    *   **Prediction (all horizons):** `0.35`
    *   **Actual Value (all horizons):** `1.0`
    *   **Absolute Error:** `|0.35 - 1.0| = 0.65`
    *   **Why Incorrect:** The model predicted a very low 35% chance of an increase, but it actually increased (resolved to 1.0). The reasoning refers to "historical QT periods" and "continued Fed tightening." It seems the model overestimated the downward pressure from quantitative tightening or underestimated other factors leading to an increase in MBS holdings by banks.

9.  **Question Number: 94 (`9043472375a02690dfb338bd3d11605105562e5cae9672a989961b0c5bef9b51`)**
    *   **Question:** Will there be more than ten times as many 'Protests' in Bahrain...
    *   **Prediction (all horizons):** `0.75`
    *   **Actual Value (all horizons):** `0.0`
    *   **Absolute Error:** `|0.75 - 0.0| = 0.75`
    *   **Why Incorrect:** The model predicted a 75% chance of a massive increase in protests, but this did not occur (resolved to 0.0). The reasoning cited "verified large-scale protests, official confirmations". This points to a failure similar to the Montenegro violence question: overestimating the scale or endurance of protests to meet a very high, specific threshold, or misinterpreting current events.

10. **Question Number: 93 (`4204aec5ff81b3d331f27141b072979d838ed95bcd0de36e887ca9a70523060a`)**
    *   **Question:** Will there be more than ten times as many 'Protests' in China...
    *   **Prediction (all horizons):** `0.65`
    *   **Actual Value (all horizons):** `0.0`
    *   **Absolute Error:** `|0.65 - 0.0| = 0.65`
    *   **Why Incorrect:** Predicted a 65% chance of a vast increase in protests, but it did not occur. The model's reasoning about "Economic stress and property sector issues driving increased protests" might be plausible for *some* increase, but not enough to meet the extreme "ten times as many" threshold. This indicates a potential miscalibration of the model's understanding of scale for thresholds defined by multiplication of a baseline.

**Summary of Errors and Underlying Issues:**

*   **Factual Inaccuracies/Hallucinations:** For questions 20 and 47, the model directly stated that events had "confirmed" or "occurred" when the actual resolution was 0.0, suggesting it may have hallucinated information or inferred outcomes that didn't happen (e.g., iPhone LLM, exoplanet discoveries). This is a critical failure.
*   **Misinterpretation of Thresholds/Baselines:** For the ACLED-style questions (violence, protests, strategic developments with "ten times as many" or "more than average"), the model frequently predicted a high probability of meeting these extreme thresholds (e.g., 92, 94, 93), but the event resolved to 0.0. This indicates the model struggles to accurately gauge the magnitude of events required to meet such high "X times the average" thresholds, or it miscalculated the baseline.
*   **Over-reliance on Recent Trends / Lack of Temporal Nuance:** For the financial and meteorological data (e.g., Temperature, T-Bills, Job Postings), the model made a single prediction across all horizons. This led to errors where a short-term trend might make the prediction correct for 7d/30d but incorrect for 90d/180d, or vice-versa. The model doesn't seem to model the *dynamics* of change over different time horizons, assuming a consistent probability regardless of whether the event is happening right now, or is expected to happen far in the future.
*   **Over-optimism/Pessimism:** For EV adoption questions (2 and 3), the model was consistently too pessimistic compared to the outcomes, while for the Elon Musk sentiment question (11), it was too optimistic. This could be due to biases in training data or a poor weighting of contributing factors.
*   **Lag in Information Processing:** Some financial questions (like the BTFP or Inflation rate T-bills) showed that while the model might have captured a general trend for longer horizons (e.g., BTFP decline), it missed very short-term counter-trends that resolved the nearest horizons.
