Key preconditions include the successful completion of ongoing research, the availability of suitable launch vehicles and spacecraft, the recruitment and training of qualified astronauts, and the resolution of any technical or logistical challenges that may arise during the mission planning and execution. While historical precedents like the Apollo program demonstrate the potential for human lunar exploration, there are also several blocking factors, such as funding constraints, geopolitical tensions, and potential operational issues, that could delay or prevent the realization of this outcome by the end of 2025. Overall, this assessment suggests a medium-level probability with a medium level of confidence in the feasibility of a new human moon landing by the end of 2025."
