      "reasoning": "The evidence strongly suggests a high likelihood that the average global temperature in 2024 will exceed that of 2023, supported by a consistent trend of record-setting temperatures and a strong consensus from climate authorities. However, several uncertainties remain that warrant a cautious approach, leading to a conservative probability estimate of 75%. This estimate reflects both the historical patterns and current conditions, while accounting for potential cooling factors and variability in climate predictions.",
