          "reasoning": "While there are significant hurdles to overcome, the overall trend towards EVs appears strong. This is reflected in the investments made by automobile manufacturers, government policies, and changing consumer attitudes. However, the exact timeline for when EVs will become the majority of new cars sold is uncertain, hence the medium confidence level.",

          "prediction": 0.65,
          "confidence": "Medium",
          "reasoning": "1. High Probability Argument: The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) is being driven by a combination of factors including government policies pushing for cleaner energy, advancements in battery technology making EVs more affordable and efficient, and a growing societal awareness of the environmental impact of fossil fuels. Many countries have already set aggressive targets to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles. Furthermore, a number of major automakers have announced plans to transition their fleets to electric over the next decade. \n\n2. Low Probability Argument: While the trend towards EVs is clear, reaching a majority by 2030 may be challenging. There are still significant obstacles to widespread adoption of EVs. These include the need for a comprehensive charging infrastructure, concerns over battery life and range, and the higher upfront costs of EVs compared to traditional vehicles. Additionally, in many developing countries where the majority of the world's population resides, such as India and parts of Africa, the adoption of EVs is still relatively low and may not catch up by 2030.\n\n3. Final Probability Estimate: 0.6\n\n4. Confidence Level: Medium\n\n5. Brief Reasoning: The transition to electric vehicles is happening but there are still significant barriers to overcome. While advancements in technology and policy shifts are likely to accelerate this trend, it is uncertain whether they will be enough to achieve a majority of new car sales being electric by 2030. The current market probability suggests a strong belief in the shift towards EVs, but it is important to consider the many variables and uncertainties involved.",
