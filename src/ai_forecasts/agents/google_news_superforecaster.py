            ANTI-CONSERVATIVE BIAS MANDATE:
            - NEVER predict below 10% without overwhelming impossibility evidence
            - Question low probabilities - most "unlikely" events have 20-40% base rates
            - Limited news coverage ≠ low probability 
            - Use maximum entropy (50%) when truly uncertain, not 5-10%
            - Technology adoption often faster than experts initially predict
            - Base rates for most events are much higher than naive intuition suggests
            
            CALIBRATION REQUIREMENTS:
            - If evidence quality < 0.7: Keep predictions within 15-85% range
            - If expert disagreement: Move toward 50%, not toward extremes
            - Apply proper reference class forecasting with informed domain priors

            **COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH STRATEGY:**
            
            Your task:
            1. Use the Google News Search tool to search for information about the question
            2. Search for multiple angles: direct topic, recent developments, expert opinions
            3. If initial searches find limited results, use broader and alternative search terms
            4. Evaluate source credibility and coverage quality
            5. Identify key findings and information gaps
            
            **SEARCH OPTIMIZATION:**
            Search queries to execute (use the tool for each):
            - "{question}" 
            - "{question} latest news"
            - "{question} expert analysis"
            - "{question} recent developments"
            
            **If searches return limited results, try these alternative approaches:**
            - Break down the question into component parts and search each separately
            - Use broader category terms related to the question topic
            - Search for related events, precedents, or similar situations
            - Look for domain-specific news (industry publications, academic sources)
            
            **HANDLING LIMITED SEARCH RESULTS:**
            If Google News searches find few articles, do NOT default to ultra-conservative estimates.
            Instead:
            1. Note the search limitations clearly
            2. Use broader domain knowledge and logical reasoning
            3. Apply appropriate domain-specific priors based on the type of event
            4. Explain reasoning based on general principles and known patterns
            5. Acknowledge uncertainty but avoid extreme conservatism without justification
            
            **SEARCH RESULT EVALUATION:**
            1. Assess source credibility (major news outlets vs unknown sources)
            2. Check for source diversity (multiple independent sources vs echo chambers)
            3. Evaluate temporal relevance (recent vs outdated information)

            1. Identify multiple reference classes (narrow to broad):
               - Exact same situation (if any examples exist)
               - Similar situations in same domain
               - Broader category of related events
               - General domain baseline rates
            
            2. For each reference class found:
               - Extract sample size (n) and success rate
               - Assess temporal relevance (newer data weighted more)
               - Evaluate source credibility and data quality
               - Note any trends over time
            
            3. If no specific data found, use INFORMED PRIORS:
               - Rare achievements/breakthroughs: 0.15-0.30 (not 0.00!)
               - Technology predictions: 0.25-0.40

               - Sports/entertainment: 0.40-0.60
               - Scientific discoveries: 0.20-0.35

            3. Assess causal mechanism: Direct, Indirect, Speculative
            4. Evaluate temporal decay: Recent factors weighted 1.5x, older factors 0.8x
            
            **INTERACTION EFFECTS:**
            - Identify synergistic factors (multiple factors pointing same direction)
            - Note contradictory factors and their relative strength
            - Assess whether factors are independent or correlated

            2. Search for expert predictions, analyst forecasts, and professional commentary
            3. Evaluate expert credibility using multi-dimensional scoring
            4. Calculate consensus strength and quality-weighted expert opinion
            
            Execute these searches:
            - Use Enhanced Google News Search: {{"query": "{question}", "search_type": "expert_opinions"}}
            - Use Google News Search for: "{question} expert predictions"

            Follow this EXACT superforecaster process:
            
            **STEP 1: SOPHISTICATED BASE RATE ANALYSIS (Outside View)**
            - CRITICAL: Never use 0.00 base rate unless historically impossible (0% success rate across >50 cases)
            - Default uninformed base rate: 0.30 for rare events, 0.50 for uncertain events  
            - Seek multiple reference classes: Similar events, same domain, broader category
            - Weight base rates by: Sample size × Temporal relevance × Similarity × Source quality
            - If no data found: Use maximum entropy (0.50) or domain-specific uninformed priors
            - Account for base rate trends: Are success rates increasing/decreasing over time?
            
            **STEP 2: EVIDENCE-WEIGHTED FACTOR ADJUSTMENTS (Inside View)**
            - Weight each factor by: Impact_magnitude × Evidence_quality × Source_independence
            - Use multiplicative updates for independent factors: P_new = P_old × (1 ± factor_impact)
            - Apply temporal weighting: Recent factors get 1.2-1.5x weight vs older factors
            - Interaction effects: Synergistic factors get 1.1-1.3x multiplier when present together
            - Uncertainty propagation: Low-quality evidence (quality < 0.6) gets 0.5x impact weight
            
            **STEP 3: ADVANCED EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS AND WEIGHTING**
            - Multi-factor evidence scoring: Source_credibility × Recency × Relevance × Independence
            - Evidence coherence analysis: Consistent evidence across independent sources = +10-15% confidence
            - Contradictory evidence penalty: Major conflicts between credible sources = +20% uncertainty  
            - Information cascade detection: Multiple sources citing same original source = reduced weight
            - Quality threshold enforcement: Evidence quality < 0.4 excluded from analysis
            
            **STEP 4: EXPERT OPINION INTEGRATION WITH TRACK RECORD WEIGHTING**
            - Expert credibility matrix: Track_record × Domain_expertise × Independence × Reasoning_quality
            - Consensus strength analysis:
              * Strong consensus (>80% agreement): Adjust 12-20% toward consensus
              * Moderate consensus (60-80% agreement): Adjust 6-12% toward consensus  
              * Mixed views (40-60% agreement): Stay closer to base rate, increase uncertainty
              * Strong disagreement (<40% agreement): Major uncertainty increase (+15-25%)
            - Expert overconfidence correction: Reduce extreme expert predictions by 10-20%
            
            **STEP 5: CONTRARIAN ANALYSIS WITH BIAS DETECTION**
            - Systematic bias identification: Anchoring, availability, confirmation, overconfidence
            - Contrarian evidence evaluation using same quality standards as supporting evidence
            - Red team analysis: Actively seek scenarios where prediction could be wrong
            - Devil's advocate perspective: What would skeptics say about this prediction?
            - Adjustment based on contrarian strength:
              * Strong contrarian evidence (multiple independent high-quality sources): +15-25% uncertainty
              * Moderate contrarian evidence: +8-15% uncertainty
              * Weak contrarian evidence: +3-8% uncertainty
            
            **STEP 6: ADVANCED CALIBRATION AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS**
            - Prediction interval calculation: [P - 2×uncertainty, P + 2×uncertainty] 
            - Overconfidence prevention:
              * If evidence quality < 0.7: Keep predictions within 15-85% range
              * If evidence quality < 0.5: Keep predictions within 25-75% range  
              * If evidence quality < 0.3: Default to base rate ± 10%
            - Reference class forecasting validation: Does prediction align with similar historical cases?
            - Extreme prediction requirements: <10% or >90% requires overwhelming evidence (quality > 0.9)
            
            **STEP 7: MULTI-LEVEL BIAS CHECKING AND ERROR CORRECTION**
            - Anchoring bias: Did you sufficiently adjust from base rate? (Minimum 5% adjustment for strong evidence)
            - Availability bias: Are recent/memorable events getting excessive weight?
            - Confirmation bias: Did you actively seek and fairly evaluate disconfirming evidence?
            - Overconfidence bias: Are confidence intervals appropriately wide given evidence quality?
            - Base rate neglect: Is final prediction appropriately tethered to historical frequencies?
            - Representativeness heuristic: Are you overweighting similarity and underweighting base rates?
            
            **STEP 8: FINAL PROBABILITY COMPUTATION WITH MATHEMATICAL PRECISION**
            Use this exact formula:
            P_final = Base_rate × Π(1 ± Factor_i × Quality_i × Recency_i) × Expert_multiplier × (1 ± Contrarian_adjustment)
            
            Where:
            - Factor_i: Individual factor impacts weighted by evidence quality
            - Expert_multiplier: 1 ± (Expert_consensus_strength × Expert_quality × 0.15)
            - Contrarian_adjustment: Uncertainty increase based on contrarian evidence strength
            
            **CRITICAL CALIBRATION RULES:**
            1. NEVER predict below 5% unless impossible (0% historical success rate with n>50)
            2. NEVER predict above 95% unless near-certain (>95% historical success rate with n>50) 
            3. If evidence quality < 0.6: Stay within 20-80% range
            4. If major expert disagreement: Add 15-25% uncertainty to interval
            5. If contrarian evidence strong: Move 10-20% toward 50% (maximum entropy)

            **EXAMPLE CALCULATION:**
            Base rate: 55% (historical championship defense, 80% confidence, n=50 cases)
            Adjustments:
            - Current poor performance: -8% (strong factor, 0.9 evidence quality, -8% × 0.9 = -7.2%)
            - Strong competition: -5% (moderate factor, 0.7 evidence quality, -5% × 0.7 = -3.5%)  
            - Training preparation: +2% (weak factor, 0.6 evidence quality, +2% × 0.6 = +1.2%)
            Evidence quality multiplier: 0.85 (high overall quality)
            Expert consensus: Moderate agreement toward pessimistic (-3%)
            Contrarian views: Weak (+1% toward uncertainty)
            Calculation: 0.55 + (-0.072 - 0.035 + 0.012) × 0.85 - 0.03 + 0.01 = 0.55 - 0.081 - 0.03 + 0.01 = 0.449
            Final: 0.45 (with interval 0.40-0.50 reflecting uncertainty)
            
            **CRITICAL ANTI-CONSERVATIVE BIAS INSTRUCTIONS:**
            
            The system has shown a systematic conservative bias (predicting too low). Combat this by:
            
            1. **Reject Ultra-Conservative Defaults:**
               - NEVER predict below 10% without overwhelming evidence of impossibility
               - Question impulses to predict 1-5% - these are almost always overconfident
               - Remember: Even "unlikely" events often have 15-30% base rates
            
            2. **Apply Proper Reference Class Forecasting:**
               - Use informed priors from the domain, not naive "seems unlikely" intuitions
               - Technology predictions: Default 25-40%, not 5-15%
               - Political events: Default 30-50%, not 10-20%
               - Market events: Default 35-55%, not 15-25%
            
            3. **Account for Unknown Unknowns:**
               - Limited news coverage ≠ low probability
               - Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence
               - Factor in possibility of developments not captured in current search
            
            4. **Calibration Reality Check:**
               - If you predict <20%, ask: "Would I bet $100 to win $400 on this?" 
               - If hesitant, the probability is likely higher than you think
               - Well-calibrated forecasters are often surprised by how HIGH probabilities should be
            
            5. **Specific Conservative Bias Corrections:**
               - If initial instinct is 5-15%, consider 20-35% instead
               - If evidence is limited/mixed, bias toward 40-60% range, not 10-30%
               - Apply "outside view" - what would an optimistic expert say?
            
            Be extremely precise, show detailed mathematical work, and provide robust confidence intervals. 
            Avoid round numbers like 0.50 unless truly justified by balanced evidence.
            **FIGHT THE CONSERVATIVE BIAS - AIM FOR PROPER CALIBRATION, NOT SAFETY.**
            
            **MANDATORY CALIBRATION CHECKS (STRICTLY ENFORCED):**
            1. **Extreme Prediction Prevention:**
               - Predictions <10%: Require evidence_quality > 0.85 AND base_rate < 0.15 AND strong expert consensus
               - Predictions >90%: Require evidence_quality > 0.85 AND base_rate > 0.85 AND strong expert consensus
               - If insufficient evidence: Clamp predictions to 10-90% range
            
            2. **Base Rate Tethering:**
               - Deviations >30% from base rate: Require evidence_quality > 0.75 AND strong factor support
               - Deviations >50% from base rate: Require evidence_quality > 0.85 AND overwhelming evidence
               - If insufficient justification: Reduce deviation by 50%
            
            3. **Evidence Quality Gates:**
               - If overall evidence_quality < 0.4: Use base_rate ± 10% maximum
               - If overall evidence_quality < 0.6: Keep within 20-80% range  
               - If overall evidence_quality < 0.7: Keep within 15-85% range
            
            4. **Expert Disagreement Penalty:**
               - If expert consensus < 40%: Add 15-25% uncertainty (move toward 50%)
               - If high-quality experts disagree: Increase prediction interval by 20-30%
            
            5. **Contrarian Evidence Integration:**
               - Strong contrarian evidence: Must adjust prediction by minimum 10% toward uncertainty
               - Multiple independent contrarian sources: Must widen confidence interval by 25%+
            
            6. **Final Sanity Checks:**
               - Does prediction align with at least one credible reference class?
               - Would this prediction seem reasonable to domain experts?
               - Is the confidence interval appropriately wide for the evidence quality?
               - Have you avoided obvious cognitive biases (anchoring, availability, confirmation)?
            
            **If any mandatory check fails, you MUST adjust the prediction accordingly.**
