## Examples

### Basic Market Analysis

```python
from manifold_markets import ManifoldForecastingBot

bot = ManifoldForecastingBot()

# Analyze top markets
markets = bot.analyze_markets(limit=5)

for market in markets:
    print(f"Question: {market.question}")
    print(f"Market: {market.current_prob:.1%}")
    print(f"AI: {market.ai_forecast.probability:.1%}")
    print(f"Difference: {market.forecast_difference:+.1%}")
    print(f"Action: {market.recommended_action}")
    print()
```

### Find Opportunities

```python
# Find markets where AI significantly disagrees
opportunities = bot.find_opportunities(
    min_difference=0.20,      # 20% difference
    min_confidence="high",    # High confidence only
    limit=50                  # Check 50 markets
)

print(f"Found {len(opportunities)} opportunities")
```

### Execute Betting Strategy

```python
# Dry run first
dry_results = bot.execute_bets(opportunities, dry_run=True, max_total_amount=100)

# If satisfied with dry run, execute for real
if input("Execute real bets? (y/N): ").lower() == 'y':
    real_results = bot.execute_bets(opportunities, dry_run=False, max_total_amount=100)
```

### Generate Analysis Report

```python
markets = bot.analyze_markets(limit=25)
report = bot.generate_report(markets)

print(f"Analyzed {report['summary']['total_markets_analyzed']} markets")
print(f"Found {report['summary']['betting_opportunities']} opportunities")
print(f"Average difference: {report['summary']['average_probability_difference']:.1%}")
```

## Configuration

### Bot Parameters

```python
bot = ManifoldForecastingBot(
    default_bet_amount=10.0,        # Default bet size in Mana
    confidence_threshold=0.15,      # Minimum difference to consider betting
    manifold_api_key="your_key",    # API keys
    openrouter_api_key="your_key",
    serp_api_key="your_key"
)
```

### Risk Management

The bot includes several risk management features:

- **Confidence thresholds**: Only bet on high-confidence predictions
- **Difference thresholds**: Require significant disagreement with market
- **Maximum bet limits**: Cap total betting amounts
- **Market filters**: Avoid closed/resolved markets
- **Time filters**: Skip markets closing soon
- **Dry run mode**: Test strategies without real money

## Understanding the Output

### Market Analysis

Each analyzed market includes:

- **Current probability**: Market's current price
- **AI probability**: AI forecast probability
- **Difference**: How much AI disagrees with market
- **Confidence**: AI's confidence level (low/medium/high)
- **Action**: Recommended action (BUY_YES/BUY_NO/HOLD/AVOID)
- **Reasoning**: AI's explanation for the forecast

### Betting Opportunities

Opportunities are ranked by:

1. **Absolute difference**: Larger disagreements ranked higher
2. **Confidence level**: Higher confidence preferred
3. **Evidence quality**: Better evidence weighted more

### Risk Indicators

- **Low confidence**: AI is uncertain, avoid betting
- **Market closing soon**: Avoid due to time risk
- **Small difference**: Below threshold, not worth betting
- **High volatility**: Market may be unstable

## Safety Features

### Dry Run Mode

Always test strategies in dry run mode first:

```python
results = bot.execute_bets(opportunities, dry_run=True)
```

### Position Limits

Set maximum betting amounts:

```python
results = bot.execute_bets(opportunities, max_total_amount=50.0)
```

### Confidence Filters

Only bet on high-confidence predictions:

```python
opportunities = bot.find_opportunities(min_confidence="high")
```

## Monitoring and Tracking

### Save Analysis Results

```python
# Save detailed analysis
import json
with open('analysis.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(report, f, indent=2)
```

### Track Performance

```python
# Monitor bet results
results = bot.execute_bets(opportunities)
successful_bets = [r for r in results if r['success']]
print(f"Placed {len(successful_bets)} bets successfully")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No OpenRouter API key"**

   - Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Check key is valid at openrouter.ai

2. **"No markets found"**

   - Check Manifold Markets is accessible
   - Try different search terms or increase limit

3. **"Failed to place bet"**

   - Verify `MANIFOLD_API_KEY` is set and valid
   - Check you have sufficient Mana balance
   - Ensure market is still open

4. **"SERP API errors"**
   - SERP key is optional but improves forecasting
   - Bot will work without it but with limited news data

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Ethics and Responsible Use

### Guidelines

- **Start small**: Begin with small bet amounts to test strategies
- **Diversify**: Don't put all money on a single prediction
- **Monitor performance**: Track accuracy and adjust strategies
- **Respect limits**: Don't exceed your risk tolerance
- **Educational use**: Consider this primarily a learning tool

### Disclaimers

- AI predictions are not guaranteed to be accurate
- Prediction markets involve financial risk
- Past performance doesn't predict future results
- Use only money you can afford to lose
- This is experimental software - use at your own risk

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Forecasting Strategy

```python
class CustomForecastingBot(ManifoldForecastingBot):
    def _determine_action(self, ai_forecast, current_prob, forecast_diff, market):
        # Custom logic for bet sizing and market selection
        # Override default behavior
        pass
```

### Batch Processing

```python
# Process many markets efficiently
all_markets = bot.manifold.get_markets(limit=500)
forecasts = []

for market in all_markets:
    forecast = bot.analyze_market(market)
    if forecast:
        forecasts.append(forecast)

# Filter and rank opportunities
opportunities = [f for f in forecasts if abs(f.forecast_difference) > 0.20]
```

### Portfolio Management

```python
# Track positions and performance
positions = bot.manifold.get_user_positions("your_username")
bets = bot.manifold.get_user_bets()

# Analyze performance
profitable_bets = [b for b in bets if b.get('profit', 0) > 0]
print(f"Profitable bets: {len(profitable_bets)}/{len(bets)}")
```
